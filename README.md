# RestAPI-NodeJS
Here's a simple Node.js file that creates a REST API using the Express framework.


## User API
This is a simple Node.js application that provides a RESTful API for managing user data. The API allows you to create, read, update, and delete user resources using HTTP requests.

### Getting started
To get started with this API, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-api.git
cd RestAPI-NodeJS
npm install
```

Running the API
To start the API server, run the following command:

```
npm start
```
The API will listen on port 3000 by default. You can access the API using a web browser or a tool like cURL.

### API endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints for managing user resources:

* GET /users
Returns a list of all users in JSON format.

* GET /users/:id
Returns the user with the specified ID in JSON format, or a 404 error if the user is not found.

* POST /users
Creates a new user using the data provided in the request body. The user data should be in JSON format.

* PUT /users/:id
Updates the user with the specified ID using the data provided in the request body. The updated user data should be in JSON format. Returns the updated user in JSON format, or a 404 error if the user is not found.

* DELETE /users/:id
Deletes the user with the specified ID. Returns the deleted user in JSON format, or a 404 error if the user is not found.

### Error handling
The API returns error responses in JSON format, with a message property that describes the error. The HTTP status codes used by the API are:

* 200 OK: for successful GET and PUT requests
* 201 Created: for successful POST requests
* 204 No Content: for successful DELETE requests
* 400 Bad Request: if the request body is malformed or missing required fields
* 404 Not Found: if the requested resource (user) is not found
* 500 Internal Server Error: for unexpected errors
